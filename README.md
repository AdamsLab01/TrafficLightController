# TrafficLightController
 Traffic light controller for Arduino/ATtiny85 multiple modes

This is code written for an ATtiny85 to control a traffic light. I used SSRs connected to the ATtiny to turn the lights on/off. 

There are several modes:

~ Standard traffic light based off real world timing of a local traffic light

~ Yellow flash

~ Red flash

~ Slow chase

~ Fast chase

~ Random or glitchy

I don’t have a schematic as it’s pretty simple, basically just the SSRs connected to the aTtiny through a current limiting resistor and a button/switch for changing modes and turning the lights on/off.
